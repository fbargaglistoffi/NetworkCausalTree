}
\arguments{
\item{N}{Sample size}

\item{w}{Individual Treatment level}

\item{g}{Neighborhood Treatment level}

\item{Y}{N x 1 vector, Observed Outcome}

\item{W}{N x 1 vector, Individual Treatment}

\item{G}{N x 1 vector, Neighborhood Treatment}

\item{p}{Probability to be assigned to the active individual intervention}

where each element i contains the IDs of the direct neighbors of unit i}
}
\value{
A numeric value corresponding to the estimated variance of the
